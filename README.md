# COFFEE-ADDICTS
# What effects does caffeine have on you?
This project allows the users to discover in a very fascinating way the main effects provoked by caffeine on our bodies.Through three different games it will be possible to visualize and experience at first hand how our heart, muscles, and sight react to this substance.
# EYE
Pressing the arrow of keyboard the user will test his own eyes, his own coordination and concentration. It will be required to connect the correct arrow with the direction taken by enlightened “E” in the grid. The sight of the user will be so stressed that he will fill a sense of discomfort.
# MUSCLES
Moving the mouse the user will try to pull the brown sugar cube in the cup. Through this game the user will experience the difficulty of doing a movement trembling. Spontaneous irritation will be generated because, despite the straight movement made by the user with the mouse, the cube will follow different paths.
# HEART
Clapping your hands it will be possible to follow the rhythm of the heart beating, that will seem more and more tachycardic. It will be very difficult to keep an high and steady volume trough the clap of your hands at an increasing speed. 
# THE AMOUNT OF CAFFEINE
You can increase or decrease the amount of assumed caffeine in each page (pressing the “+” or “-” bottom) consequently you can experience the different effects in relation of the amount of caffein chosed.
# DROWSINESS
Few people know that one of the effect of caffeine is drowsiness. We have tried to represent this aspect by making all the games end suddenly, as if the user felt asleep because of the amount of caffeine assumed.
# DIFFICULTIES
We had some difficulties trying to arrange the pages, mainly, to make all the pages resizable. We tried to resize the pages through transformation, proportions and scaling factors. At the end, we did not succeed in using any of these factors since we could not resize some of the elements involved in more complicated functions. Consequently we have adopted a different solution, using the HTML and changing the style of the body and of the head creating some margins in order to make the canvas blocked. This is the reason why the visualization of the page is damaged every time it is resized after the first load. Anyway, you only need to reload the page in order to make it automatically readjust exactly in the center of the window. The most difficult part we found in the “eye game” has been rotating in different directions the E. We managed to solve this problem by using a “cycle for” in another “cycle for” whose variables has been put in the functions rotate and translate. The main problem we had to face in the “muscles game” has been to work on the single element of the grid. The grid is an object, for this reason, we were not able to work easily on the single items of it. Each operation made on the single object of the “object grid” and not on the entireness has been difficult to manage but we solved the problems thanks to many attempts and researches. The main difficulty we found in the “heart game” has been finding the correct speed so that the heartbeat increases in a scientific and consistent way until it arrives to 4bps which is the average rhythm of a tachycardic heart.
